This module is for making appointment bookings. It is dependant on the payment module and google calendar.
Currently only DPSPayment is supported. This work was heavily based on the payment-test module.

Zend Gdata classes are used to communicate with the google calendar, the Zend library is included in 
code/library/Zend/.
